### OVERVIEW
---
This project analyzes sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The project uses Excel, SQL and Power BI to analyze a 50,000 sales record for a retail shop. 

#### KEY FEATURES

- Sales Performance Metrics (Revenue, Sales Growth, Average Order Revenue)
- Sales Channel Analysis (Product, Region)

#### DATA SET 

The dataset was given by the incubator hub and contains 50,000 sales record from the past year.

#### METHODOLOGY

The dataset was given in an excel workbook, it was then transferred to a new workbook and then I checked for duplicates. 

I used the **conditional formatting function which is found in the styles group on the Home tab** to check for duplicate values, it highlighted the whole table but to be completely certain, I used the **COUNTIFS** function which also proved to me that i had rows with the same records. 

I proceeded to remove duplicate by using the **remove duplicate function under the data tools group in the DATA tab**. I was left with 9921 rows which I used to perform my analysis. I ensured that all duplicates had been removed by using the **COUNTIFS** function again and it returned only 1 record for each series of criterias thereby proving that I now had a clean dataset.
